A secondary transport is a transport that is connected as an alternate, higher bandwidth transport for situations when a low-bandwidth primary transport (such as Bluetooth) will restrict certain features (such as video streaming navigation).

 This will only affect apps that have high-bandwidth requirements; currently that is only video streaming navigation apps.
